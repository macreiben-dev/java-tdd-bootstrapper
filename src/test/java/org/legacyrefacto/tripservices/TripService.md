This kata has been created by Sandro Mancuso. 

The original version is here : https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata

## Description 

Kata for legacy code hands-on session. The objective is to test and refactor the legacy TripService class.

The end result should be well-crafted code that express the domain.

You can watch the video with my solution. Although quite long, I explain my whole thought process while writting tests, how I break dependencies, the reasons for refactoring and re-desining the code (tests and production code), and why certain steps are important. I also cover how often I commit and why I do it.

The video is full of tips and tricks that can be used in any language.
