# Java TDD bootstrapper

This repo contains several kata description that can be used to train on TDD.

src/test contains the kata description for tdd plus the trip services from Mancuso.

An empty test class has been added. Ensure that the tit est class is failing.

## Trip services

This kata is not TDD related but legacy code recovery related. 

So, the legacy code has been added to src.org.legacyrefactos.tripservices.

See kata description in test/org.legacyrefactos.tripservices.
